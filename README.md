## Senior Project | Thai Hand Written Recognition using CNN (ResNet50)
This is just one part of my Senior Project, the preprocessing phase."

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The research team extends heartfelt thanks to everyone who supported us. 
<br> We are grateful to Assoc. Prof. Dr. Chomthip Pornpanomchai for invaluable guidance and advice, 
<br> as well as to all teachers, senior colleagues, and parents for their unwavering support

## Objectives
The goal of Thai handwritten recognition is to create technology that accurately converts handwritten Thai script into digital text. This involves using deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve accuracy. By leveraging machine learning methods and large datasets of handwritten Thai characters, we aim to develop systems capable of recognizing diverse writing styles. Ultimately, our research aims to make Thai handwritten recognition a valuable tool for various industries and individuals in the digital age.

**Our project consist of 4 parts including:** <br>
- Preprocessing |  You can look out our repository  [here](https://github.com/J1gsaww/SeniorProject_Part1_Data-Preprocessing.git). <br>
- Training | You can look out our repository  [here](https://github.com/J1gsaww/SeniorProject_Part2_Train_ThaiHandWritten-Recognition-with-ResNet-50.git). <br>
- Evaluating | Current repository <br>
- Displaying | You can look out our repository [here](https://github.com/J1gsaww/SeniorProject_SeniorProject_Part4_GUI-Demo.git). <br>

## Evaluating
**Required library:** sklearn (SciKit-learn) and Seaborn<br>
<br> **Command: Install sklearn** <br>`pip install -U scikit-learn (Windows)`
<br>`pip install -U numpy scipy scikit-learn (MacOSX)`

**Command: Install Seaborn** <br>`pip install seaborn (Windows)`
<br>`pip3 install seaborn (MacOSX)`

This python script to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of model that predicts Thai Handwritten Characters in the form of `Confusion Matrix` that can analyze when matrix is the form of `Diagonal Matrix`.
<br>`Diagonal Matrix` shows that the model get a high accuracy for predictions process.

<br>To specified dataset folder: **Don't forget to change path to your path**

## Result
<br>Confusion Matrix 57x57
